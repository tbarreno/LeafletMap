## R-Practices

This repository contains some *peer-graded* assignments for the
[Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)
on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

### Leaflet Map

The goal is to create a web page using **R Markdown** that features a map created
with [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/).

This submit shows the 82 [Cascade volcanoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_Volcanoes)
over a topographic map of the United States.

The map could be viewed
[here](https://tbarreno.github.io/R-Practices/Leaflet/Cascade_Volcanoes.html).

### Plotly

The goal is to create a HTML Presentation page using **R Markdown**
that features plots created with [Plotly](https://plot.ly/).

My submit shows some plots about
[New York City noise complains](https://www.kaggle.com/somesnm/partynyc)
over 2016 (the dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)).

The presentation could be viewed
[here](https://tbarreno.github.io/R-Practices/Plotly/2016-NYC-Parties.html).
