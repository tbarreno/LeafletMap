## Leaflet Map

This project is a *peer-graded* assignment for the [Data Product](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products)
course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

Our goal is to create a web page using **R Markdown** that features a map created with [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/).

My submit shows the 82 [Cascade volcanoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_Volcanoes)
over a topographic map of the United States.
The map could be view [here](https://tbarreno.github.io/LeafletMap/Cascade_Volcanoes.html).
